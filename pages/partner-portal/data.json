        "para2": "As a good corporate citizen, we have been ranked the ‘Number 1 Most Respected FMCG Company’ in Sri Lanka for the 17th consecutive year (LMD’s Most Respected Entities in Sri Lanka, 2022), adjudged the ‘Number 1 Employer of Choice’ for the 11th consecutive year (NielsenIQ, 2022) and crowned the ‘Best Corporate in Sri Lanka for fostering Employee Relations’ in 2022 (Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards 2022), among many other accolades. ",
        "para3": "Our commitment to enhance the livelihoods of the communities we operate in, is as strong today as it was when we began operations in the country in 1938.

        "description": "If you were to ask an AIESECer in Sri Lanka to name one of the most used words in their AIESEC vocabulary, Unilever is bound to be on the list. It is not only because of the proud presence of the organization but because of the purposeful partnership that binds two like-minded organizations, AIESEC Sri Lanka and Unilever LK since 2015 and its impact. Unilever LK has always been a proud partner that we’ve had to develop the talent of our membership.",
